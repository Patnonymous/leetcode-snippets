Achieve O(n) complexity by mapping the numbers we already process.

Initialize a list that will hold the processed numbers.
The format in Python3 is:
processedNums = {}
We store values as value: index.

So loop through every number in the nums list.
Get the remainder, which is the target number minus the current nums[index]:
remainder = target - nums[index]

Then check if the remainder is in our processed numbers list.
If it is, return the current index and the inex of the processed remainder.

Finally, if a solution was not found add the current number to the processed numbers list:
processedNums[value] = index
